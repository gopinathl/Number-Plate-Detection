# Number-Plate-Detection

The massive integration of information technologies, under different aspects of the modern world, has led to the treatment of vehicles as conceptual resources in information systems. Since an autonomous information system has no meaning without any data, there is a need to reform vehicle information between reality and the information system.

This project helps detecting the number plates from vehicles of different countries and extracts the number plate text which can be used for commercial purposes.
